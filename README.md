## ‚öôÔ∏è Components of the Chip Emulator

This repository contains the following core components:

- **Memory Management**: Centralized handling of memory for ROM operations and program execution.
- **Instruction Handlers**:
  - `_execute_opcode`: Processes the main opcodes.
  - `_execute_extended_x`: Handles extended instruction sets (e.g., for 8, E, and F groups of opcodes).
- **Graphics and Input**:
  - Screen rendering logic with `_screen`.
  - Keyboard input handling via `_keyboard`.
- **ROM Handling**:
  - **`_load_rom_data`**: Loads all necessary ROM data.
  - **`_load_default_character_set`**: Prepares the default character set for rendering.
- **Sound Management**:
  - `_play_sound`: Plays sound for supported beeps and tones.

These components are carefully designed to emulate the behavior of a Chip system and provide an accurate environment for running ROMs.

## üöÄ Usage

1. Place your ROM file in the project directory or specify its path.
2. Run the emulator script and pass the ROM file for execution.
3. Enjoy the execution on the emulator screen with interactive input and sound.

Example command to run the Chip Emulator:

```bash
python chip.py your_rom_file.rom
```

## ü§î How It Works

The Chip Emulator functions by dividing its responsibilities across specialized methods and attributes. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of its working components:

- **Opcode Execution**: The `logic()` and `_execute_opcode()` methods handle the decoding and execution of opcodes, allowing programs to function as intended.
- **ROM Management**: The `_load_rom_data()` method loads the specified ROM, which is then processed character-by-character in the memory model.
- **Graphics Output**: The `_screen` attribute is responsible for rendering graphical output on a scalable grid defined by `_screen_multiplier`.
- **Input and Interaction**: Utilizing `_keyboard`, the emulator efficiently maps key inputs to the simulated system.
- **Sound Play**: `_play_sound()` generates simple sound outputs for an authentic user experience.

This approach ensures modularity and maintainability, simplifying future enhancements or modifications.
